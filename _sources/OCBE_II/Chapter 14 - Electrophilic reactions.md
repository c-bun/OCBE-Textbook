## Introduction 

Linnda Caporael probably should have paid a little more attention to the
graduation requirements in her college catalog. Going through the
graduation checklist during her senior year, she discovered to her
dismay that she still needed to fulfill a social science requirement, so
she promptly enrolled in an American History course. It was a decision
that would in time lead to her authoring a paper in a prestigious
scientific journal, being featured in a front page story in the New York
Times, and changing our understanding of one of the most intriguing -
and disturbing – episodes in American history.

Professor Caporael (Linnda went on to become a professor of Behavioral
Psychology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) recounted her story in
an episode of the PBS documentary series [*Secrets of the
Dead*](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/witches-curse-clues-evidence/1501/).
Early in the semester, she learned that as part of her history course
she would be required to complete a research paper on a topic of her own
choosing. She had recently seen a performance of *The Crucible*, Arthur
Miller's classic play about the Salem witch trials, and decided to do
her research on Anne Putnam, one of the young Salem girls who accused
several village women of bewitching them. The symptoms of 'bewitchment'
that afflicted the girls were truly frightening: thrashing and
convulsions, visions of snakes and ferocious beasts, a sudden inability
to speak, and a feeling that ants were crawling under their skin.

> These children were bitten and pinched by invisible agents: their
> arms, necks and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back
> again, so as it was, impossible for them to do of themselves, and
> beyond the power of any epileptick fits, or natural disease to effect.
> Sometimes they were taken dumb, their mouth flopped, their throats
> choaked, their limbs wracked and tormented. . .

*(From “A Modest Enquiry Into the Nature of Witchcraft” (1702) by
Reverend John Hale.*
<http://historyofmassachusetts.org/betty-parris-first-afflicted-girl-of-the-salem-witch-trials/>*)*

As Linnda continued to read accounts of the 'fits' afflicting the Salem
girls, she was suddenly struck by the similarities to another, more
recent episode that she had read about. In the summer of 1951, in the
French village of Pont Saint Esprit, a number of local people were
simultaneously seized by hallucinations, convulsions, and other symptoms
very much like those described during the Salem witch trials hundreds of
years earlier. Leon Armunier, a former postman in Pont Saint Esprit,
described his experience to the BBC:

> It was terrible. I had the sensation of shrinking and shrinking, and
> the fire and the serpents coiling around my arms . . .Some of my
> friends tried to get out of the window. They were thrashing wildly. .
> . screaming, and the sound of the metal beds and the jumping up and
> down... the noise was terrible. I'd prefer to die rather than go
> through that again.

There have been several explanations offered for what caused the Pont
Saint Esprit outbreak (including that the CIA was experimenting with
mass LSD poisoning as a form of chemical warfare), but the most widely
accepted theory is that the hallucinations were caused by eating bread
made from contaminated grain.

*Claviceps purpurea*, a fungus known to grow in rye and other grains,
produces a class of hallucinogenic compounds called 'ergot alkaloids'
which are derived from lysergic acid (the hallucinogenic drug LSD is a
synthetic derivative of lysergic acid). *Claviceps* thrives in damp
grain, and special care must be taken to avoid contamination when
storing grain grown during warm, rainy summers.

fig 1a

Digging deeper into the records of the Salem witchcraft episode, Linnda
Caporael learned that the summer of 1691 was unusually damp. The first
cases of 'bewitchment' in Salem village occurred in the winter of
1691-1692, when the villagers would have been consuming grain stored
from the previous summer. Rye, the kind of grain most vulnerable to
*Claviceps* contamination, was the staple crop in Salem at the time.
Furthermore, nearly all of the affected girls lived on farms on the
swampy western edge of the town, where *Claviceps* contamination would
have been most likely to occur.

This was all circumstantial evidence, to be sure, but it was enough to
convince Linnda that ergot poisoning was much more plausible as a root
cause of the behavior of the afflicted girls than simply mass hysteria,
which had long been the accepted theory. She summarized her findings in
a paper that was later published in the journal *Science*, with the
colorful title "Ergotism: The Satan Loosed in Salem?" (*Science*
**1976**, *192*, 21). Her theory is still not universally accepted, but
scientists and historians are for the most part in agreement that ergot
poisoning was the cause of other outbreaks of convulsions and
hallucinations, often called 'Saint Anthony's Fire', that have occurred
throughout European history. It is possible that ergot poisoning may
have played a role in literature as well: professor Caporael, in an
interview with PBS, recounts how she was recently contacted by an
historian with in intriguing idea. Is it possible that Caliban, the
wild, half-human character in Shakespeare's *The Tempest* who is
tormented by hallucinations inflicted upon him by the wizard Prospero,
could be a literary manifestation of ergot poisoning episodes that
occurred in England during Shakespeare's time?

> For every trifle are they set upon me;  
> Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me  
> And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which  
> Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount  
> Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I  
> All wound with adders who with cloven tongues  
> Do hiss me into madness.

*(*William Shakespeare's *The Tempest*, Act II scene ii)

In this chapter, we will learn about a class of organic reaction that is
central to the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids in *Claviceps*. The key
first step in the biosynthetic pathway is a reaction unlike any we have
yet seen:

<img src="media/image427.png"
style="width:5.16667in;height:4.51875in" />

fig 1b

As you can see, the first step is condensation between the amino acid
tryptophan and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the building block
molecule for isoprenoids (section 1.3A). What you should also notice in
the reaction figure above is that a new carbon-carbon bond is formed,
and yet the chemistry involved is clearly very different from the
carbon-carbon bonding forming aldol additions and Claisen condensations
we learned about in the previous two chapters: there is no carbonyl to
be found anywhere near the site of reaction, and one of the bond-forming
carbons is part of an aromatic ring.

We will see later in this chapter that this reaction mechanism is
classified as an 'electrophilic aromatic substitution', and is one of a
broader family of organic reaction mechanisms that includes
electrophilic additions, substitutions, and isomerizations.
'Electrophilic' is the key term here: in organic chemistry, an
'electrophilic' reaction mechanism is one in which the π-bonded
electrons in a carbon-carbon double (or sometimes triple) bond are drawn
towards an electron-poor species, often an acidic proton or carbocation.
In essence, the π bond is acting as a nucleophile or base.

<img src="media/image428.png"
style="width:5.87986in;height:1.11111in" />

fig 1

Notice above that, once the π bond breaks and a new  bond forms, the
second carbon that was part of the original π bond becomes a
carbocation. Carbocation intermediates play a critical role in this
chapter, because a carbocation is a highly reactive species and will
quickly attract a pair of electrons. The stability of the carbocation
intermediate (recall that we learned about carbocation stability in
section 8.5), and the manner in which it accepts a pair of electrons,
plays a key role in determining the outcome of the reaction.

## Section 14.1: Electrophilic addition 

### 14.1A: Addition of HBr to alkenes

The simplest type of electrophilic reaction to visualize is the addition
of a haloacid such as HBr to an isolated alkene. It is not a biological
reaction, but nonetheless can serve as a convenient model to introduce
some of the most important ideas about electrophilic reactions.

Electrophilic addition of HBr to an alkene:

<img src="media/image429.png"
style="width:4.12986in;height:1.33333in" />

fig 1

Step 1 is an acid-base reaction: the π electrons of the alkene act as a
base and extract the acidic proton of HBr. This leaves one of the
carbons with a new bond to hydrogen, and the other with an incomplete
octet and a positive formal charge. In step 2, the nucleophilic bromide
anion attacks the electrophilic carbocation to form a new carbon-bromine
bond. Overall, the HBr molecule - in the form of a proton and a bromide
anion - has been *added* to the double bond.

To understand how π-bonded electrons in an alkene could be basic, let's
first review the bonding picture for alkenes. Recall (section 2.1C) that
the both of the carbons in an alkene group are *sp<sup>2</sup>*
hybridized, meaning that each carbon has three *sp<sup>2</sup>* hybrid
orbitals extending out in the same plane at 180<sup>o</sup> angles
(trigonal planar geometry), and a single, unhybridized *p* orbital
oriented perpendicular to that plane - one lobe above the plane, one
lobe below.

<img src="media/image430.png"
style="width:1.24097in;height:1.33333in" />

fig 2

The unhybridized *p* orbitals on the two alkene carbons overlap, in a
side-by-side fashion, to form the π bond, which extends above and below
the plane formed by the σ bonds. The two electrons shared in this π bond
are farther away from the carbon nuclei than the electrons in the
carbon-carbon σ bond, and thus are more accessible to the acidic proton.
In addition, recall that molecular orbital (MO) theory tells us that π
orbitals are higher in energy than σ orbitals (section 2.2). As a
consequence, it is easier to break the π bond of an alkene than it is to
break the σ bond: the π bond is more reactive.

As the HBr molecule approaches the alkene, a new σ bond is formed
between one of the alkene carbons and the electron-poor proton from HBr.
The carbon, which was *sp<sup>2</sup>* hybridized when it was part of
the alkene, is now *sp<sup>3</sup>* hybridized. The other alkene carbon
is still *sp<sup>2</sup>* hybridized, but it now bears a positive formal
charge because it has only three bonds, and its *p* orbital is empty.
But it won't stay empty for long: a carbocation is a very reactive,
unstable intermediate. The bromide ion will rapidly act as a
nucleophile, filling the orbital with a pair of electrons, and now with
four σ bonds the carbon is *sp<sup>3</sup>*-hybridized.

The first step in the electrophilic addition reaction is much slower
than the second step, because the intermediate carbocation species is
higher in energy than either the reactants or the products, and as a
result the energy barrier for the first step is also higher than for the
second step. The slower first step is the rate-determining step: a
change in the rate of the slow step will effect the rate of the overall
reaction, while a change in the rate of the fast step will not.

<img src="media/image431.png"
style="width:4.44444in;height:2.85208in" /> (fig 3)

fig 2a

It is important to recognize the inherent difference between an
*electrophilic* addition to an alkene and a *conjugate* addition to an
alkene in the  position, the latter of which we studied earlier in
section 13.4. In both reactions, a proton and a nucleophile add to the
double bond of an alkene. In a conjugate addition, the nucleophilic
attack takes place first, resulting in a negatively charged intermediate
(an enolate). Protonation is the *second* step. Also, of course, the
alkene must be conjugated to a carbonyl or imine.

<img src="media/image432.png" style="width:5.25in;height:3.75in" />

fig 3

In an electrophilic addition, proton abstraction occurs *first*,
generating a positively-charged intermediate. Nucleophilic attack is the
second step. No conjugated carbonyl or imine group is required: in fact
a nearby carbonyl group would actually slow down a hypothetical
electrophilic addition reaction down because a carbonyl is an electron
withdrawing, carbocation-destabilized group.

### 14.1B:The stereochemistry of electrophilic addition

Depending on the structure of the starting alkene, electrophilic
addition has the potential to create two new chiral centers. Addition of
HBr to an alkene is *not* stereoselective: the reaction results in
racemization at *both* of the alkene carbons. Consider the addition of
HBr to *cis*-3,4-dimethyl-3-hexene. The initial proton abstraction step
creates a new chiral center, and because the acidic proton could be
added to either side of the planar alkene carbon with equal probability,
the center could have either *S* or *R* configuration.

<img src="media/image433.png"
style="width:5.16667in;height:4.35208in" />

fig 4

Likewise, in the second step the nucleophilic bromide ion could attack
from either side of the planar carbocation, leading to an equal mixture
of S and R configuration at that carbon as well. Therefore, we expect
the product mixture to consist of equal amounts of four different
stereoisomers.

<u>Exercise 14.1</u>: Predict the product(s) of electrophilic addition
of HBr to the following alkenes. Draw all possible stereoisomers that
could form, and take care not to draw identical structures twice.

a\) *trans*-2-butene b) *cis*-3-hexene c) cyclopentene

### 14.1C: The regiochemistry of electrophilic addition 

In many cases of electrophilic addition to an alkene, regiochemistry
comes into play: the reaction can result in the formation of two
different constitutional isomers. Consider the electrophilic addition of
HBr to 2-methylpropene:

(fig 4)

<img src="media/image434.png"
style="width:5.12986in;height:2.04653in" />

fig 5

Note that carbon \#1 and carbon \#2 in the starting alkene are *not* the
same - carbon \#2 is bonded to two methyl groups, and carbon \#1 to two
hydrogen atoms. The initial protonation step could therefore go two
different ways, resulting in two different carbocation intermediates.
Notice how pathway '**a**' gives a tertiary carbocation intermediate
(I<sub>a</sub>), while pathway '**b**' gives a primary carbocation
intermediate (I<sub>b</sub>) We know from section 8.5 that the tertiary
carbocation I<sub>a</sub> is lower in energy. Consequently, the
transition state TS(a) leading to I<sub>a</sub> is lower in energy than
TS(b), meaning that I<sub>a</sub> forms *faster* than I<sub>b</sub>.

<img src="media/image435.png" style="width:3.75in;height:2.57431in" />

fig 6

Because the protonation step is the rate determining step for the
reaction, tertiary alkyl bromide A will form faster than the primary
alkyl bromide B, and thus A will be the predominant product of the
reaction. *The electrophilic addition of HBr to 2-methylpropene is
regioselective: more than one constitutional isomer can potentially
form, but one isomer is favored over the other.* It is generally
observed that in electrophilic addition of haloacids to alkenes, the
more substituted carbon is the one that ends up bonded to the heteroatom
of the acid, while the less substituted carbon is protonated. This 'rule
of thumb' is known as **Markovnikov's rule**, after the Russian chemist
Vladimir Markovnikov who proposed it in 1869.

While it is useful in many cases, Markovikov's rule does not apply to
all electrophilic addition reactions. It is better to use a more general
principle:

**The regioselectivity of electrophilic addition**

When an asymmetrical alkene undergoes electrophilic addition, the
product that predominates is the one that results from the more stable
of the two possible carbocation intermediates.

How is this different from Markovnikov's original rule? Consider the
following hypothetical reaction, in which the starting alkene
incorporates two trifluoromethyl substituents:

<img src="media/image436.png"
style="width:4.55556in;height:2.46319in" />

fig 7

Now when HBr is added, it is the *less* substituted carbocation that
forms faster in the rate-determining protonation step, because in this
intermediate the carbon bearing the positive charge is located further
away from the electron-withdrawing, cation-destabilizing fluorines. As a
result, the predominant product is the secondary rather than the
tertiary bromoalkane. This is referred to as an **anti-Markovnikov**
addition product, because it 'breaks' Markovnikov's rule.

If the two possible carbocation intermediates in an electrophilic
addition reaction are of similar stability, the product will be a
mixture of constitutional isomers.

<img src="media/image437.png" style="width:5.61111in;height:2.25in" />

fig 8

### 14.1D: Electrophilic addition of water and alcohol 

The (non-biochemical) addition of water to an alkene is very similar
mechanistically to the addition of a haloacid such as HBr or HCl, and
the same stereochemical and regiochemical principles apply. A catalytic
amount of a strong acid such as phosphoric or sulfuric acid is required,
so that the acidic species in solution is actually
H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. Note that H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is
regenerated in the course of the reaction.

<img src="media/image438.png"
style="width:5.13889in;height:2.47222in" />

fig 9

If an alkene is treated with methanol and a catalytic amount of strong
acid, the result is an ether:

<img src="media/image439.png"
style="width:4.35208in;height:1.35208in" />

fig 10

<u>Exercise 14.2</u>: Draw a mechanism for the ether-forming reaction
above.

### 14.1E: Addition to conjugated alkenes

Electrophilic addition to conjugated alkenes presents additional
regiochemical possibilities, due to resonance delocalization of the
allylic carbocation intermediate. Addition of one molar equivalent of
HBr to 1,3-butadiene, for example, leads to a mixture of three products,
two of which are a pair of enantiomers due to the creation of a chiral
center at carbon \#2.

<img src="media/image440.png" style="width:5.5in;height:1.88889in" />

<u>Exercise 14.3</u>: Explain why 4-bromo-1-butene is *not* a
significant product of the reaction above.

<u>Exercise 14.4</u>: Predict the major product(s) of the following
reactions. Draw all possible stereoisomers, and take care not to draw
the same structure twice.

### 14.1F: Biochemical electrophilic addition reactions

Myrcene is an isoprenoid compound synthesized by many different kinds of
plants and used in the preparation of perfumes. Recently an enzymatic
pathway for the degradation of myrcene has been identified in bacteria
(*J. Biol. Chem* **2010**, *285*, 30436). The first step of this pathway
is electrophilic addition of water to a conjugated alkene system.

<img src="media/image446.png"
style="width:4.21319in;height:0.94444in" />

fig 15

<u>Exercise 14.5</u>: Draw a mechanism for the above reaction, showing
two resonance contributors of the carbocation intermediate. How would
you characterize the intermediate?

Although the hydration of myrcene above looks very familiar, many
enzyme-catalyzed electrophilic addition reactions differ from what we
have seen so far, in that the electron-poor species attacked by the
π-bonded electrons in the initial step is a *carbocation* rather than an
acidic proton:

<img src="media/image447.png"
style="width:5.37986in;height:1.37986in" />

fig 13

*Alpha*-terpineol, a major component in the sap of pine trees, is formed
in an electrophilic addition reaction. The first thing that happens
(which we will refer to below as 'step a', in order to keep the step
numbering consistent what the addition mechanisms we have seen so far)
is departure of a pyrophosphate leaving group, forming an allylic
carbocation electrophile.

<img src="media/image448.png" style="width:6in;height:3.30213in" />

fig 14

The actual electrophilic addition stage of the reaction begins with step
1, as the π electrons an alkene are drawn toward one of the two carbons
that share the positive charge, effectively closing a six-membered ring.
A water molecule then attacks the second carbocation intermediate (step
2), which completes the addition process.

Notice something important about the regiochemical course of the
reaction: step 1 results in the formation of a six-membered ring and a
tertiary carbocation. As we have stressed before, biochemical reactions
tend to follow energetically favorable mechanistic pathways.

<u>Exercise 14.6</u>: An alternate regiochemical course to step 1 shown
above could result in a seven-membered ring and a secondary carbocation,
a much less energetically favorable intermediate in terms of both
carbocation stability and ring size. Draw a mechanism for this
hypothetical alternate reaction, and show the product that would result
after the addition of water in a hypothetical 'step 2'.

## Section 14.2: Elimination by the E1 mechanism

### 14.2A: E1 elimination - an overview

The reverse of electrophilic addition is called **E1 elimination**. We
will begin by looking at some non-biochemical E1 reactions, as the E1
mechanisms is actually somewhat unusual in biochemical pathways.

E1 elimination:

<img src="media/image449.png"
style="width:4.37986in;height:1.08333in" />

fig 16

An E1 elimination begins with the departure of a leaving group
(designated 'X' in the general figure above) and formation of a
carbocation intermediate (step 1). Abstraction of a proton from an
adjacent carbon (step 2) sends two electrons down to fill the empty *p*
orbital of the carbocation, forming a new π bond. The base in this step
may be the leaving group, or another basic species in solution.

E1 elimination does not occur when the leaving group is bonded to a
primary carbon, unless the carbon is in the allylic or benzylic
position. Recall that a primary carbocation, unless stabilized by
resonance, is highly unstable and an unlikely reaction intermediate.

E1 eliminations can occur at secondary carbons, however. If cyclohexanol
is heated with a catalytic amount of phosphoric acid, elimination of
water (dehydration) results in cyclohexene as the product. The role of
the phosphoric acid is to protonate the alcohol ('step a' below), making
it a viable leaving group.

<img src="media/image450.png"
style="width:5.65764in;height:2.97222in" />

fig 17

The reaction is reversible, but if cyclohexene is distilled away from
the reaction mixture as it forms, the equilibrium can be driven towards
product (you may want to review Le Chatelier's principle in your General
Chemistry textbook). Separation of cyclohexene (boiling point 83
<sup>o</sup>C) from cyclohexanol (boiling point 161 <sup>o</sup>C) is
simple because of the large difference in boiling points between the two
liquids.

<u>Exercise 14.7</u>: When the laboratory reaction described above is
run to completion, a viscous 'goop' is usually left over in the
distillation flask, which hardens upon cooling. Draw a mechanism showing
how this 'goop' might form, and explain why it hardens upon cooling.

### 14.2B: Regiochemistry of E1 elimination

Nonenzymatic E1 reactions can often result in a mixture of more than one
alkene product. Elimination of 'HX' from the following starting
compound, for example, could yield three different possible alkene
products.

<img src="media/image451.png" style="width:6in;height:2.92695in" />

fig 18

Notice in the figure above that the three possible E1 products do not
form in equal abundance. *The most abundant alkene product is that which
is most substituted*: in other words, the alkene in which the two
*sp<sup>2</sup>* carbons are bonded to the fewest hydrogen atoms. In
this case, the most substituted alkene has zero hydrogen substituents.
The least substituted - and least abundant - alkene product has two
hydrogen substituents, while the middle alkene has one hydrogen
substituent. This trend is observed generally with nonenzymatic E1
elimination reactions, and is known as **Zaitsev's rule** after the
Russian chemist Alexander Zaitsev.

### 14.2C: Stereochemistry of E1 elimination

Nonenzymatic E1 reactions can also result in both *cis* and *trans*
alkenes. Keeping in mind that in general *trans* alkenes are more stable
than *cis* alkenes, we can predict that *trans* alkenes will predominate
in the product mixture.

<img src="media/image452.png"
style="width:5.08333in;height:1.16667in" />

fig 19

<u>Exercise 14.8</u>: Draw the structures of all possible E1 products
starting with the compounds below, and rank them in order of highest to
lowest abundance.

<img src="media/image453.png"
style="width:4.43542in;height:1.30556in" />

fig 20

### 14.2D: The E2 elimination mechanism

When a strong base is combined with an alkyl halide (or alkyl
tosylate/mesylate), elimination generally occurs by the **E2 pathway**,
in which proton abstraction and loss of the leaving group occur
*simultaneously*, without an intervening carbocation intermediate:

<img src="media/image454.png"
style="width:5.12986in;height:1.58333in" />

fig 20a

Just like in the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, the '2' in the E2 designation
refers to the idea that the rate-determining (and only) step of the
reaction is a collision between the two reacting molecules, in this case
bromocyclohexane and methoxide ion.

### 14.2E: Competition between elimination and substitution

Consider a reaction between water and bromocyclohexane. Based on what we
have just learned, a likely product would be the alkene formed from an
E1 elimination reaction (pathway (a) in red below).

<img src="media/image455.png"
style="width:4.32431in;height:2.16667in" />

fig 20c

However, the reaction could take another course: what if the water
molecule, instead of acting as a base, were to act as a nucleophile
(pathway (b) in blue? This should look familiar - it is simply an
S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction (section 8.1B). In fact, the reaction would
result in a mixture of elimination (E1) and substitution
(S<sub>N</sub>1) products. This is a common theme: elimination and
substitution often compete with each other.

When both elimination and substitution products are possible, however,
we can often predict which reaction will predominate. In general,
*strong bases and hindered carbons favor elimination, while powerful
nucleophiles and unhindered carbons favor substitution*.

<img src="media/image456.png"
style="width:4.54653in;height:4.97222in" />

fig 20b

In addition, primary alkyl halides are much more likely to undergo
substitution than elimination, even when the nucleophile is also a
strong base, because the electrophilic carbon is unhindered and
accessible to the nucleophile. Recall that the Williamson ether
synthesis (section 8.9A) is an efficient laboratory S<sub>N</sub>2
reaction between a primary (or methyl) alkyl halide and an alkoxide. If
a secondary alkyl halide is used, a substantial amount of elimination
product will form (the electrophilic carbon is more hindered, and the
alkoxide will act as a base as well as a nucleophile).

<img src="media/image457.png"
style="width:4.71319in;height:2.07431in" />

fig 20e

While competition between substitution and elimination pathways is an
issue for chemists running reactions in the lab, the same cannot be said
of biochemical reactions, as the architecture active site of enzymes
have evolved to ensure the formation of only one product.

<u>Exercise 14.9</u>: Predict the *major* organic product(s) of the
following reactions. If the reaction is expected to result in a mixture
of elimination and substitution product, show both.

a\) bromocyclopentane plus ethoxide

b\) 1-chlorohexane plus CH<sub>3</sub>S<sup>-</sup>

c\) 2-iodo-2-methylpentane plus hydroxide

### 14.2F: Biochemical E1 elimination reactions 

Looking through metabolic pathways in a biochemistry textbook, you'll
see that almost all elimination reactions appear to be of the E1cb type,
occurring on carbons in the β position relative to a carbonyl or
imine. A relatively small number of elimination steps, however, take
place away from the electron-withdrawing influence of a carbonyl or
imine, and these are of the carbocation-intermediate, E1 type. The E2
mechanism is very rare in biochemical pathways.

A reaction in the histidine biosynthetic pathway (EC 4.2.1.19) provides
an example of a biological E1 dehydration step:

<img src="media/image458.png" style="width:6in;height:3.25259in" />

fig 21a

Notice that an E1cb mechanism is not possible here - there is no
adjacent carbonyl or imine and thus no possibility for a stabilized
anionic intermediate. Instead, the first step is loss of water to form a
resonance-stabilized carbo*cation* intermediate. Deprotonation completes
the E1 phase of the reaction to form an enol, which rapidly tautomerizes
to a ketone.

Another example of a biological E1 reaction is found in the biosynthesis
pathway for aromatic amino acids (EC 2.5.1.19):

<u>Exercise 14.11</u> : Another step (EC 4.2.3.5) in the aromatic acid
biosynthesis pathway could be referred to as a *conjugated* E1
elimination of phosphate, the mechanistic reverse of electrophilic
addition to a conjugated diene (section 14.1E). Draw a complete
mechanism for this reaction, showing two resonance contributors of the
carbocation intermediate.

In section 13.3, we saw some Claisen condensation reactions in which the
usual proton-abstracton step was replaced by decarboxylation. A similar
thing can happen with E1 eliminations:

compounds, is a product of this type of hybrid decarboxylation /

b\) What two main factors contribute to the 'driving force' for this
reaction?

## Section 14.3: Electrophilic alkene isomeration 

Electrophilic reactions in biochemistry are not limited to *addition* to
alkene double bonds. The position of a double bond in an alkene can also
be shifted through an electrophilic, carbocation-intermediate reaction.
An electrophilic alkene *isomerization* occurs when an initial π bond
protonation event (step 1 below) is followed by deprotonation of an
adjacent carbon to re-form the π bond in a different location.

Electrophilic isomerization mechanism:

<img src="media/image464.png"
style="width:5.74097in;height:1.07431in" />

fig 27

In a key early step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds,
isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the isoprenoid 'building block' molecule,
is isomerized to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (EC 5.3.3.2).

<img src="media/image465.png"
style="width:5.47222in;height:2.05556in" />

fig 28

In the first step, the π bond between carbon \#3 and carbon \#4 is
protonated by a cysteine residue in the active site. X-ray
crystallography studies on the isomerase enzyme (*EMBO J*. **2001**,
*20*, 1530) show that the carbocation intermediate is bound in a very
deep, hydrophobic active site cavity that seals out any water molecules
that could potentially attack the carbocation to form an undesired
alcohol product. Instead, a basic glutamate residue is positioned in the
active site to abstract a proton from carbon \#2 (step 2), serving to
reestablish the double bond in a new position between carbons \#2 and
\#3.

## Section 14.4: Electrophilic substitution

We have already been introduced to electrophilic addition and
electrophilic isomerization - now, let's move to the third variation on
the electrophilic theme, that of electrophilic substitution. In an
electrophilic substitution reaction, a pair of π-bonded electrons first
attacks an electrophile - usually a carbocation species - and a proton
is then abstracted from an adjacent carbon to reestablish the double
bond, either in the original position or with isomerization.

Electrophilic substitution mechanism:

<img src="media/image466.png"
style="width:5.68542in;height:3.61111in" />

fig 29

### 14.4A: Electrophilic substitution reactions in isoprenoid biosynthesis

Electrophilic substitution steps are very important in the biosynthetic
pathways if isoprenoid compounds. In an early, chain-elongating reaction
(EC 2.5.1.1) of the pathways of many isoprenoids, building blocks IPP
and DMAPP combine to form a 10-carbon isoprenoid product called geranyl
diphosphate (GPP):

<img src="media/image467.png" style="width:5.52778in;height:1in" />

fig 30

In a preliminary step (step a below), the diphosphate group on DMAPP
departs to form an allylic carbocation.

<img src="media/image468.png"
style="width:4.80556in;height:3.77778in" />

fig 32

In step 1, the π electrons in IPP then attack the electrophilic
carbocation from step a, resulting in a new carbon-carbon bond and a
tertiary carbocation intermediate. Proton abstraction (step 2) leads to
re-establishment of a double bond one carbon over from where it started
out in IPP.

<u>Exercise 14.13</u>: DMAPP is much more prone to spontaneous
hydrolysis than IPP when they are dissolved in water. Explain why.

<u>Exercise 14.14</u>: Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is synthesized by
adding another five-carbon building block to geranyl diphosphate. What
is this building block - IPP or DMAPP? Draw a mechanism for the
formation of FPP.

<img src="media/image469.png" style="width:2.76875in;height:0.75in" />

fig 33a

<u>Exercise 14.15</u>: Propose a likely mechanism for the following
transformation, which is the first stage in a somewhat complex reaction
in the synthesis of an isoprenoid compound in plants. (*Science*

<img src="media/image470.png" style="width:3.99097in;height:1.25in" />

fig 33

<u>Exercise 14.16</u>: The electrophilic carbon in an electrophilic
substitution reaction is often a carbocation, but it can also be the
methyl group on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM - see section 8.8A). Propose a
likely mechanism for this methylation reaction. (*Biochemistry*
**2012**, *51*, 3003)

<img src="media/image471.png"
style="width:5.26875in;height:1.05556in" />

### 14.4B: Electrophilic aromatic substitution 

Until now, we have been focusing mostly on electrophilic reactions of
alkenes. Recall from section 2.2C that π bonds in aromatic rings are
substantially less reactive than those in alkenes. Aromatic systems,
however, do in fact undergo electrophilic substitution reactions given a
powerful electrophile such as a carbocation, and if the carbocation
intermediate that forms can be sufficiently stabilized.

Electrophilic aromatic substitution (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
mechanism

<img src="media/image472.png" style="width:5.25in;height:1.18542in" />

fig 34

Organic chemists often refer to electrophilic aromatic substitution
reactions with carbocation electrophiles as **Friedel-Crafts
alkylation** reactions.

<u>Exercise 14.17</u>: Aromatic rings generally do not undergo
electrophilic *addition* reactions. Why not?

The Friedel-Crafts reaction below is part of the biosynthesis of vitamin
K and related biomolecules.

<img src="media/image473.png"
style="width:5.51875in;height:3.76875in" />

fig 36

Loss of diphosphate creates a powerful carbocation electrophile (step a)
which attracts the π electrons of the aromatic ring to form a
carbocation intermediate with a new carbon-carbon bond (step 1).
Substitution is completed by proton abstraction (step 2) which
re-establishes the aromatic sextet.

An important point must be made here: because aromatic π bonds are
substantially less reactive than alkene π bonds, the electrophilic must
be VERY electrophilic - usually a carbocation. In addition, the
carbocation intermediate that results from attack by aromatic π
electrons is generally stabilized by resonance with lone pair electrons
on a nearby oxygen or nitrogen (look at the resonance forms of the
positively-charged intermediate that forms as the result of step 1 in
the above figure).

*Remember that stabilizing the intermediate formed in a rate-limiting
step has the effect of lowering the activation energy for the step, and
thus accelerating the reaction.*

Organic chemists use the term **ring activation** to refer to the
rate-accelerating effect of electron-donating heteroatoms in
electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Aromatic rings lacking
any activating oxygen or nitrogen atoms are less reactive towards
electrophilic substitution.

An example of the ring-activating effect of the nitrogen atom on an
aromatic ring can be found in the following Friedel-Crafts reaction (EC
2.5.1.34), which should be familiar from the introduction to this
chapter:

<img src="media/image474.png"
style="width:5.15764in;height:1.66667in" />

fig 37

Recall that this is a key early step in the biosynthetic pathway for the
ergot alkaloids which are hypothesized to have been the root cause of
the 'bewitchment' of several young girls in 17th century Salem,
Massachusetts. (*J. Am. Chem. Soc.* **1992***,114,* 7354).

<u>Exercise 14.18</u>: Draw a likely mechanism for the biosynthesis of
dimethylallyl tryptophan, including a resonance structure showing how
the carbocation intermediate in the rate determining step is stabilized
by lone pair electrons on the ring nitrogen (in other words, show how
the nitrogen serves to *activate* the ring).

Friedel-Crafts reactions, in addition to being important biochemical
transformations, are commonly carried out in the laboratory. It is
instructive to consider a few examples to see how the same principles of
structure and reactivity apply to both biochemical and laboratory
reactions.

Below is an example of a laboratory Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction:

<img src="media/image475.png"
style="width:3.85208in;height:0.79653in" />

fig 37a

Recall that a powerful electrophile - such as a carbocation - is
required for an electrophilic aromatic substitution to occur. The
2-chloropropane reactant is electrophilic, but not electrophilic enough
to react with benzene. Here's where the aluminum trichloride catalyst
comes in: it reacts as a Lewis acid with the alkyl chloride to generate
a secondary carbocation:

<img src="media/image476.png"
style="width:3.68542in;height:0.72222in" />

fig 37b

The carbocation thus generated is sufficiently electrophilic to react
with the aromatic π electrons, in a manner that should be familiar from
the biochemical examples discussed above:

<img src="media/image477.png"
style="width:5.22222in;height:1.55556in" />

fig 37c

You may have noticed, however, that one element from the biochemical
Friedel-Crafts reactions is missing here: there is no activating group
to stabilize the ring carbocation intermediate. Indeed, the presence of
an activating group - for example, the oxygen atom of a methoxy
substituent - greatly increases the rate of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

<img src="media/image478.png"
style="width:5.68542in;height:1.87986in" />

fig 37d

Note in the example shown above that two products are formed: one is an
*ortho*-disubstituted benzene and one is *para*-disubstituted. Note also
that no *meta*-disubstituted product is formed. This phenomenon is
referred to as the ***ortho*-*para* directing effect**, and you are led
towards an explanation in the exercise below.

<u>Exercise 14.19</u>:

a\) Draw the lowest-energy resonance contributors of the carbocation
intermediates leading to formation of the *ortho* and *para* products in
the reaction above. Use resonance structures to illustrate how the
methoxy substituent is a ring-activating group.

b\) Draw the *hypothetical* carbocation intermediate in a reaction
leading to formation of a *meta*-disubstituted product. Is this
carbocation stabilized by the methoxy oxygen? Can you see why no *meta*
product forms?

<u>Exercise 14.20</u>:

a\) Just as there are ring-activating groups in electrophilic aromatic
substitutions, there are also ring-***de***activating groups. For each
of the substituted benzene reactants below, draw the carbocation
intermediate leading to the *ortho* substitution product and decide
whether the substituent is ring-activating or ring-deactivating in a
Friedel-Crafts reaction with 2-chloropropane and AlCl<sub>3</sub> (in
other words, which compounds would react *faster* than benzene, and
which would react *slower*?) Explain how the ring-deactivating effect
works.

<img src="media/image479.png"
style="width:4.36111in;height:1.21319in" />

b\) (*challenging*!) Ring-deactivating substituents are usually also
*meta*-directing. Use one of your carbocation intermediate drawings from
part (a) of this exercise, and the concept od resonance, to explain this
observation.

c\) (*answer part (b) first*) Look again at the vitamin K biosynthesis
reaction, and discuss the ring activating/directing effects of the two
substituents on the substrate.

## Section 14.5: Carbocation rearrangements

Earlier in this chapter we introduced the so-called 'Markovnikov rule',
which can be used to predict the favored regiochemical outcome of
electrophilic additions to asymmetric alkenes. According to what we have
learned, addition of HBr to 3-methyl-1-butene should result in a
secondary bromoalkane. However, the predominant product that is actually
be observed in this reaction is a *tertiary* alkyl bromide! Little or no
secondary alkyl bromide forms.

<img src="media/image480.png"
style="width:3.07431in;height:2.10208in" />

fig 38

To explain this result, let's take a look at the mechanism for the
reaction:

Electrophilic addition with a hydride shift:

<img src="media/image481.png"
style="width:5.26875in;height:3.91667in" />

fig 39

Protonation of the double bond results in a secondary carbocation (step
1). What happens next (step 2 above) is a process called a **carbocation
rearrangement,** and more specifically, a **hydride shift.** The
electrons in the bond between carbon \#3 and a hydrogen are attracted by
the positive charge on carbon \#2, and they simply shift over to fill
the empty *p* orbital, pulling the proton over with them. Notice that
the hydride, in shifting, is *not* acting as an actual leaving group - a
hydride ion is a very strong base and a very poor leaving group.

An important reminder: a hydride ion (H<sup>-</sup>) is a proton *plus
two electrons*. Be sure not to confuse a hydride ion with H<sup>+</sup>,
which is *just* a proton without any electrons.

As the shift proceeds, a new C-H σ bond is formed at carbon \#2, and
carbon \#3 is left with an empty *p* orbital and a positive charge.

<img src="media/image482.png"
style="width:4.94444in;height:1.99097in" />

fig 40

What is the thermodynamic driving force for this process? Notice that
the hydride shift results in the conversion of a secondary carbocation
to a (more stable) tertiary carbocation - a thermodynamically *downhill*
step. As it turns out, the shift occurs so quickly that it is
accomplished before the bromide nucleophile has time to attack at carbon
\#2. Rather, the bromide will attack (step 3) at carbon \#3 to complete
the addition.

Consider another example. When HBr is added to 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene,
the product is a tertiary - rather than a secondary - alkyl bromide.

<img src="media/image483.png"
style="width:2.87986in;height:2.10208in" />

fig 41

Notice that in the observed product, *the carbon framework has been
rearranged*: the methyl carbon indicated by a red dot has shifted from
carbon \#3 to carbon \#2. This is an example of another type of
carbocation rearrangement, called a **methyl shift**.

Below is the mechanism for the reaction. Once again a secondary
carbocation intermediate is formed in step 1. In this case, there is no
hydrogen on carbon \#3 available to shift over create a more stable
tertiary carbocation. Instead, it is a methyl group that does the
shifting, as the electrons in the carbon-carbon σ bond move over to fill
the empty orbital on carbon \#2 (step 2 below).

Electrophilic addition with methyl shift:

<img src="media/image484.png"
style="width:5.43542in;height:4.02778in" />

fig 42

The methyl shift results in the conversion of a secondary carbocation to
a more stable tertiary carbocation. The end result is a rearrangement of
the carbon framework of the molecule.

<u>Exercise 14.21:</u> Which of the following carbocations are likely to
undergo a shift? If a shift is likely, draw the new carbocation that
would result.

<u>Exercise 14.22</u>: In the (non-biochemcial) reactions below, the
major product forms as the result of a hydride or methyl shift from a
carbocation intermediate. Predict the structure of the major product for
each reaction, disregarding stereochemistry.

<u>Exercise 14.23</u>: Draw the most abundant product of this laboratory
Friedel-Crafts reaction:

<img src="media/image491.png" style="width:2.75in;height:0.66667in" />

fig 43a

Carbocation rearrangements are involved in many known biochemical
reactions. Rearrangements are particularly important in
carbocation-intermediate reactions in which isoprenoid molecules cyclize
to form complex multi-ring structures. For example, one of the key steps
in the biosynthesis of cholesterol is the electrophilic cyclization of
oxidosqualene to form a steroid called lanosterol (E.C. 5.4.99.7).

<img src="media/image492.png"
style="width:4.91667in;height:1.80556in" />

fig 44

This complex but fascinating reaction has two phases. The first phase is
where the actual cyclization takes place, with the formation of four new
carbon-carbon bonds and a carbocation intermediate. This phase is a
'cascade' of electrophilic alkene addition steps, beginning with
addition of an electrophilic functional group called an 'epoxide'.

The epoxide functional group - composed of a three membered ring with
two carbons and an oxygen - is relatively rare in biomolecules and
biochemical reactions, and for this reason it is not discussed in detail
in this book. However, epoxides are an important and versatile
intermediate in laboratory organic synthesis, so you will learn much
more about how they are made and how they react if you take a course in
chemical synthesis. For now, it is sufficient to recognize that the
carbon atoms of an epoxide are potent electrophiles, due to both the
carbon-oxygen bond dipoles and the inherent strain of the three membered
ring.

The second phase involves a series of hydride and methyl shifts
culminating in a deprotonation. In the exercise below, you will have the
opportunity to work through the entire cyclase reaction mechanism. In
section 15.7, we will take a look at how the epoxide group of
oxidosqualene is formed. *Trends Pharm. Sci*. **2005**, *26*, 335; *J.
Phys Chem B*., **2012**, *116*, 13857.

<u>Second phase</u>: rearrangement and deprotonation

<img src="media/image494.png" style="width:6in;height:4.17696in" />

fig 46

c\) Look at the first and last steps of the entire process: overall,
would you describe this as an electrophilic addition or substitution?

The oxidosqualene cyclization reaction and others like it are truly
remarkable examples of the exquisite control exerted by enzymes over the
course of a chemical reaction. Consider: an open-chain starting molecule
is converted, by a single enzyme, into a complex multiple fused-ring
structure with *seven* chiral centers. Oxidosqualene could potentially
cyclize in many different ways, resulting in a great variety of
different products. In order for the enzyme to catalyze the formation of
a *single* product with the correct connectivity and stereochemistry,
the enzyme must be able to maintain precise control of the conformation
of the starting compound and all reactive intermediates in the active
site, while also excluding water molecules which could attack at any of
the positively charged carbons.

**P14.11:** Researchers investigated the mechanism of the enzyme
3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase by running the
reaction with one of the substrates labeled with the <sup>18</sup>O
isotope (colored red in the scheme below). Consider the two hypothetical
results shown below, each pointing to a different mechanism. Both
mechanisms involve a carbocation intermediate. (*Biochem. Biophys. Res.

with <sup>18</sup>O) that could confirm or rule out a alternative,
*concerted* isomerization mechanism (*ie*. one without formation of a
carbocation intermediate). Explain your reasoning.

**P14.14:** Ketones and aldehydes with a hydroxy group in the  position
are known to undergo an isomerization reaction known as an **acyloin
rearrangement**:

style="width:4.74097in;height:1.36111in" />

Notice in the general acyloin rearragnement mechanism below, the green
alkyl group is *shifting* from the  carbon (red) to the carbonyl carbon
(blue). Notice also that this shift does not involve a carbocation
intermediate, although a resonance contributor can be drawn in which the
carbonyl carbon has a positive charge.

biosynthetic pathway for the amino acid leucine:

described as an intramolecular electrophilic aromatic
substitution/decarboxylation hybrid, followed by an E1 dehydration (EC
4.1.1.48).

a\) Draw a mechanism that corresponds to the verbal description given
above. Use resonance structures to show how the nitrogen atom helps to
stabilize the carbocation intermediate. *Hint*: the electrophilic carbon
in this case is a ketone rather than a carbocation.

b\) What aspect of this reaction do you think helps to compensate for
the energetic disadvantage of not having a powerful carbocation
electrophile?

c\) Again thinking in terms of energetics, what is the 'driving force'
for the dehydration step?

**P14.19**: Strictosinide, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the
deadly poison strychnine, is formed from two steps: a) intermolecular
imine formation, and b) an intramolecular, ring-forming electrophilic
aromatic substitution with the imine carbon from step (a) as the
electrophile.

Given this information, predict the two precursors to strictosinide, and
draw a mechanism for the reaction described. Hint: use the 'retro'
skills you developed in chapters 12 and 13.

**P14.20**: In the introduction to chapter 8, we learned about reactions
in which the cytosine and adenine bases in DNA are methylated. In the
course of that chapter, we learned how adenine N-methylation occurs in
bacteria, but we were not yet equipped to understand cytosine
C-methylation, which was the more relevant reaction in terms of human
health and development. Now we are: propose a reasonable mechanism for
the C-methylation of cytosine.

**P14.21**: The reaction below has been proposed to proceed via a
cyclization step followed by an E1/decarboxylation step (in other words,
an E1 mechanism where decarboxylation occurs instead of deprotonation).
Draw a mechanism that fits this description, and show the most stable
resonance contributors of the two key cationic intermediates.
