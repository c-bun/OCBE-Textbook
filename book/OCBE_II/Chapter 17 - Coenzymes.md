The old black and white photograph is haunting. A young boy, perhaps 10
or 11 years old, huddles against a wall outside a soup kitchen, his
mouth in an odd twisted shape that could be expressing either pain or
defiance, his eyes staring straight into those of the viewer. Tucked
into his pants, almost like a pistol in a holster, is a metal spoon.

The photograph was taken in the Netherlands in 1945, at the height of
what the Dutch people still refer to simply as "The Hunger Winter". With
the western part of the country still occupied by the Nazis, the Dutch
resistance government, based in London, had called for a railway strike
with the aim of stopping German troop movements before a planned
airborne invasion by Allied forces. In retaliation, the Germans cut off
all food shipments to cities in the western Netherlands. The Allied
invasion failed to liberate the country, and the winter of 1944-1945
turned out to be bitterly cold. With food supplies dwindling, rations
were cut first to 1000 calories per day, then to 500. People resorted to
eating grass and tulip bulbs just to stay alive. Over 20,000 people died
of starvation before food shipments were restored in the spring.

As tragic as the Hunger Winter was for the Dutch people, some good did
come from it. For medical scientists, the event became a unique 'social
experiment': unlike most episodes of famine throughout human history,
the Hunger Winter had a clearly defined beginning, end, and geographic
boundary, and it occurred in a technologically advanced society that
continued to keep thorough records before, during, and after the ordeal.
Scientists knew exactly who suffered from famine and for precisely how
long, and in the years that followed they were able to look at the
long-term effects of famine, particularly on developing embryos.
Researchers found that babies who had been conceived during the famine
were born with a significantly higher incidence of neurological birth
defects such as spina bifida, a condition in which a portion of the
neural tube protrudes from between vertebrae which did not properly fuse
together during fetal development. Later in life, members of this same
cohort of 'famine babies' were more likely to be obese, and to suffer
from schizophrenia.

These initial findings spurred interest in further research into the
consequences of prenatal deprivation. In particular, carefully
controlled studies later led to the recognition of the importance of the
vitamin folate in ensuring proper neurological development in early-term
fetuses.

Folate - the conjugate base of folic acid - is an organic **coenzyme**:
a helper molecule that binds in the active site of certain enzymes and
plays a critical role in the biochemical reaction being catalyzed.
Recall that we have seen coenzymes at work before: SAM, ATP,
NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> and NAD(P)H, flavin and glutathione are all important
coenzymes with which we are already familiar.

Because prenatal folate deficiency was found to be directly related to
the incidence of spina bifida and other neural tube defects, health
officials in the United States and many other countries changed their
official guidelines to include a specific recommendation that women
begin taking folate supplements as soon as they knew that they are
pregnant, or better yet as soon as they begin trying to become pregnant.
A number of studies conducted during the 1980s and early 1990s
consistently showed that folate supplementation correlated with a 50-70%
reduction in neural tube defects.

The molecular role of folate in prenatal neurological development is not
understood in detail, but most researchers agree that it probably has a
lot to do with DNA biosynthesis. Like S-adenosyl methionine (SAM),
folate functions in 1-carbon transfer reactions, including several
critical steps in the nucleic acid biosynthesis pathways. The rapidly
dividing cells of the developing brain of an early term fetus appear to
be especially sensitive to folate deficiency in the mother's diet:
insufficient folate leads to impaired DNA biosynthesis, which in turn
leads to defects in brain development.

Folate also serves as a 1-carbon donor in the pathway by which SAM is
regenerated after it donates a methyl group. You may recall from the
introduction to chapter 8 that methylation of cytosine bases in DNA by
SAM results in permanent changes to a individual's genome - this was the
reason why the two 'identical' twin sisters in that introductory story
turned out to be, as they grew older, not so identical after all. It is
likely that the folate deprivation that afflicted expectant mothers
during the Dutch Hunger Winter also caused epigenetic changes (in other
words, changes in the extent of DNA methylation) in their developing
fetuses, which decades later manifested in the form of an increased
incidence of conditions such as obesity and schizophrenia. All the more
reason, we now know, to make sure that women get plenty of folate in
their diet early in the first trimester of pregnancy.

In this final chapter, we focus on the organic chemistry of folate,
along with three other coenzymes: pyridoxal phosphate, thiamine
diphosphate, and lipoamide. Humans can synthesize lipoamide, but we
depend on dietary sources for the other three: pyridoxal phosphate is a
form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and thiamine diphosphate is a form of
vitamin B<sub>1.</sub> In a mechanistic sense, there is really nothing
new in this chapter. All of the reaction mechanism types that we will
see are already familiar to us, ranging from nucleophilic substitutions
(chapter 8) to disulfide exchanges (chapter 15). We will soon see,
however, how each coenzyme plays its own specific and crucial role in
assisting enzymes with the catalysis of key reactions of metabolism. We
will begin with pyridoxal phosphate and its various roles in amino acid
metabolism.

## Section 17.1: Pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>)

The coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate (commonly abbreviated PLP) is the
active form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, or pyridoxine.

fig 1

PLP is required for over 100 different reactions in human metabolism,
primarily in the various amino acid biosynthetic and degradation
pathways. The essential function of PLP is to act as an 'electron sink',
stabilizing a negative formal charge that develops on key reaction
intermediates. Some of reactions will be familiar to you from chapter 12
and 13: we will see examples, for instance, of PLP-dependent α-carbon
racemization, as well as aldol- and Claisen-type reactions. Other
reactions will be less familiar: for example, the participation of PLP
allows for decarboxylation of amino acids, a chemical step which would
be highly unlikely without the coenzyme, and PLP is also required for a
very important class of biochemical transformation called
'transamination', in which the amino group of an amino acid is
transferred to an acceptor molecule. Before we dive into the reactions
themselves, though, we need to begin by looking at a key preliminary
step that is common to all of the PLP reactions we will see in this
section.

### 17.1A: PLP in the active site: the imine linkage

The common catalytic cycle of a PLP-dependent enzyme begins and ends
with the coenzyme *covalently* linked to the enzyme's active site
through an imine linkage between the aldehyde carbon of PLP and the
amine group of a lysine residue (see section 10.5 to review the
mechanism for imine formation). For a PLP-dependent enzyme to become
active, a PLP molecule must first enter the active site of an enzyme and
form an imine link to the lysine. This state is often referred to as an
**external aldimine**.

<img src="media/image715.png"
style="width:4.86111in;height:2.86111in" />

fig 2

The first step of virtually all PLP-dependent reactions is
transimination (section 10.5), as the amino group on the amino acid
substrate displaces the amino group of the enzymatic lysine. This
state - where the coenzyme is covalently linked to the substrate or
product of the reaction - is often referred to as an **internal
aldimine**.

<img src="media/image716.png"
style="width:5.08333in;height:2.74097in" />

fig 3

With the preliminary transimination accomplished, the real PLP chemistry
is ready to start. The versatility of PLP in terms of its ability to
assist with a wide variety of reaction types is illustrated by the
figure below, showing how, depending upon the reaction/enzyme in
question, PLP can assist in the cleavage of any one of the four bonds to
the α-carbon of the amino acid substrate.

<img src="media/image717.png"
style="width:3.40764in;height:2.24097in" />

fig 4

Let's look first at the reaction catalyzed by PLP-dependent alanine
racemase. (EC 5.1.1.1).

### 17.1B: PLP-dependent amino acid racemization

In section 12.2B we saw an example of a PLP-*independent* amino acid
racemization reaction, in which the negatively-charged intermediate was
simply the enolate form of a carboxylate:

<img src="media/image718.png"
style="width:5.29653in;height:1.08333in" />

fig 5

Many other amino acid racemase reactions, however, require the
participation of PLP.

Like all other PLP-dependent reactions that we will see in this section,
PLP-dependent amino acid racemization begins with a preliminary step in
which the substrate becomes attached to the coenzyme through a
transimination. Once it is linked to PLP in the active site, the
α-proton of an amino acid substrate is abstracted by an active site base
(step 1 below). The negative charge on the carbanion intermediate can,
of course, be delocalized to the carboxylate group. The PLP coenzyme,
however, provides an expanded network of conjugated π-bonds over which
the electron density can be delocalized all the way down to the PLP
nitrogen. This is what we mean when we say that the job of PLP is to act
as an ‘**electron sink**’: the coenzyme is very efficient at absorbing,
or delocalizing, the excess electron density on the deprotonated
α-carbon of the reaction intermediate. *PLP is helping the enzyme to
increase the acidity of the α-hydrogen by stabilizing the conjugate
base*. A PLP-stabilized carbanion intermediate is commonly referred to
as a **quinonoid intermediate**. Note that in the overall reaction
equation below, PLP appears below the reaction arrow in brackets,
indicating that it participates in the mechanism but is regenerated as
part of the reaction cycle.

PLP-dependent amino acid racemization:

<img src="media/image719.png"
style="width:3.26875in;height:1.69444in" />

Mechanism:

<u>Preliminary step - transimination:</u>

<img src="media/image720.png"
style="width:5.08333in;height:2.74097in" />

<u>First step - deprotonation:</u>

<img src="media/image721.png" style="width:6in;height:2.58333in" />

Second step - reprotonation from the opposite side:

<img src="media/image722.png"
style="width:3.63889in;height:2.32431in" />

<u>Final step - transimination:</u>

<img src="media/image723.png"
style="width:4.82431in;height:2.38889in" />

fig 7

fig 6 fig 6a

Just as in the PLP-independent racemase reactions, reprotonation occurs
on the *opposite* side of the substrate (step 2), leading to the D-amino
acid product.

All that remains is the final imine exchange which frees the D-amino
acid product and re-attaches the coenzyme to the enzymatic lysine
side-chain, ready to begin another catalytic cycle.

*To simplify matters, from here on we will not include the preliminary
and final transimination steps in our PLP reaction figures - we will
only show mechanistic steps that occur while the substrate is attached
to the coenzyme (the internal aldimine forms).*

###  17.1C: PLP-dependent decarboxylation

In the amino acid racemase reaction above, PLP assisted in breaking the
α-carbon to α-proton bond of the amino acid. Other PLP-dependent enzymes
can catalyze the breaking of the bond between the α-carbon and the
carboxylate carbon by stabilizing the resulting carbanion intermediate:
these are simply decarboxylation reactions.

PLP-depended amino acid decarboxylation:

<img src="media/image724.png"
style="width:2.44444in;height:0.88889in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image725.png"
style="width:5.97222in;height:5.52778in" />

fig 8 fig 9

Notice something very important here: while in racemization reactions
the assistance of PLP can be seen as 'optional' (in the sense that some
racemase enzyme use PLP and others do not), the coenzyme is *essential*
for amino acid decarboxylation steps. Without PLP, there is no way to
stabilize the carbanion intermediate, and decarboxylation is not a
chemically reasonable step.

<img src="media/image726.png"
style="width:2.77778in;height:1.02778in" />

fig 10

One example of a PLP-facilitated decarboxylation reaction is the final
step in the lysine biosynthesis pathway: (EC 4.1.1.20).

style="width:4.54653in;height:1.24097in" />

fig 11

Exercise 17.1: Draw mechanistic arrows for the carbon-carbon
bond-breaking step of the PLP-dependent decarboxylation reaction above.

### 17.1D: PLP-dependent retroaldol and retro-Claisen cleavage 

*(It would be a good idea before reading this section to review
aldol/retro-aldol and Claisen/retro-Claisen reaction mechanisms in
sections 12.3 and 13.3, respectively)*

So far we have seen PLP playing a role in breaking the bond between the
α-carbon and its α-proton (in the racemization reaction), and the bond
between the α-carbon and carboxylate carbon (in the decarboxylation
reaction).

<img src="media/image717.png"
style="width:3.40764in;height:2.24097in" />

fig 4

Other PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze cleavage of the bond between the
α-carbon and the first carbon on the amino acid side chain, otherwise
known as the β-carbon. In the serine degradation pathway, serine is
first converted to glycine by a retro-aldol cleavage reaction. Although
a reasonable mechanism could be proposed without the participation of
PLP, this reaction in fact requires the coenzyme to assist in
stabilization of the negative charge on the carbanion intermediate.

A PLP-dependent retro-aldol cleavage reaction

(serine hydroxymethyl transferase, EC 2.1.2.1)

<img src="media/image728.png"
style="width:4.37986in;height:1.44444in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image729.png"
style="width:5.21319in;height:2.58333in" />

fig 12 fig 13

Note that, in this reaction just as in the racemase reaction described
previously, the key intermediate is a PLP-stabilized carbanion, or
quinonoid.

What happens to the (toxic!) formaldehyde produced in this reaction? We
will see later in this chapter how the serine hydroxymethyltransferase
enzyme goes on to use another coenzyme called tetrahydrofolate to
prevent the formaldehyde from leaving the active site and causing damage
to the cell.

PLP also assists in retro-Claisen cleavage reactions (section 13.3C),
such as this step in the degradation of threonine. (EC 2.3.1.29)

A PLP-dependent retro-Claisen reaction:

<img src="media/image730.png"
style="width:3.90764in;height:1.13889in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image731.png"
style="width:5.74097in;height:5.43542in" />

fig 14 fig 15

Notice how, like the retro-aldol reaction, the bond between the α-carbon
and the β-carbon of the amino acid substrate is broken (in step 1b).

### 17.1-E: PLP-dependent transamination 

One of the most important reaction types in amino acid metabolism is
**transamination**, in which an amino group on a donor molecule (often
an amino acid) is transferred to a ketone or aldehyde acceptor molecule.

A transamination reaction:

<img src="media/image732.png"
style="width:5.61111in;height:0.99097in" />

Transamination phase 1 (transfer of amino group from amino acid
substrate to coenzyme)

style="width:4.88889in;height:2.07431in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image734.png"
style="width:5.08333in;height:4.33333in" />

fig 16 fig 17 fig17a

Once again, step 1 is abstraction of the α-proton from the PLP-substrate
adduct. However, in a transaminase reaction this initial deprotonation
step is immediately followed by reprotonation at what was originally the
aldehyde carbon of PLP (step 2 above), which results in a new
carbon-nitrogen double bond (in other words, an imine) between the
α-carbon and the nitrogen atom of the original amino acid. The
repositioned imine group is then hydrolyzed (step 3 above), breaking the
carbon-nitrogen bond, transferring the amino group to the coenzyme, and
releasing an α-keto acid.

The coenzyme, which now carries an amine group and is called
**pyridoxamine phospate** (PMP), next transfers the amine group to
α-ketoglutarate (to form glutamate) through a reversal of the whole
process depicted above.

Mechanism:

*see exercise below*

fig 18

In a transamination reaction, the PLP coenzyme not only provides an
electron sink, it also serves as a temporary 'parking place' for an
amino group as it is transferred from donor to acceptor.

<u>Exercise 17.2</u>: Show a complete, step-by-step mechanism for 'phase
2' of the transamination reaction above.

Here is an example of a transamination reaction in the arginine
biosynthesis pathway: EC 2.6.1.11

transaminase reaction.

b\) Which carbon on the substrate side of the reaction will eventually
become the α-carbon of arginine?

<u>Exercise 17.4</u>: Propose a pathway, with three enzymatic steps, for
the biosynthesis of serine from 3-phosphoglycerate. Include a
generalized ('-ase') enzyme name for each step. Glutamate plays a role
in the process as an amino group donor.

### 17.1F: PLP-dependent β-elimination and β-substitution 

*(Before starting this section, it would be a good idea to review E1cb
β-elimination and conjugate addition reaction mechanisms in chapter
13.4)*

By now it should be pretty apparent that PLP is a pretty versatile
coenzyme! Two more reaction types in the PLP toolbox are β-elimination
and β-substitution on amino acid substrates.

In a PLP-dependent β-elimination reaction, the coenzyme simply helps to
stabilize the carbanion intermediate of the E1cb mechanism:

Serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13) catalyzes a PLP-dependent β-elimination
in the first step of the serine degradation pathway:

style="width:5.16667in;height:3.40764in" />

fig 23

A β-substitution reaction is simply E1cb elimination followed directly
by the reverse reaction (conjugate addition) with a different
nucleophile (Y in the figure below):

In many bacteria, the synthesis of cysteine from serine includes a
PLP-dependent β-substitution step (EC 2.5.1.47).

fig 25

<u>Exercise 17.5</u>: Draw a mechanism for the conjugate addition phase
of the reaction above (end with the cysteine-PLP adduct).

### 17.1G: PLP-dependent γ-elimination and γ-substitution reactions

The electron sink capability of PLP allows some enzymes to catalyze
eliminations at the γ-carbon of some amino acid side chains, rather than
at the β-carbon. The secret to understanding the mechanism of a
γ-elimination is that PLP essentially acts as an electron sink *twice* -
it absorbs the excess electron density from not one but two proton
abstractions.

PLP-dependent γ-elimination

<img src="media/image743.png"
style="width:2.72222in;height:1.02778in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image744.png"
style="width:5.13889in;height:4.83333in" />

fig 26 fig 27

In a familiar first step, the α-proton of the amino acid is abstracted
by an enzymatic base, and the electron density is absorbed by PLP. Next
comes the new part - before anything happens to the electron density
from the first proton abstraction, a second proton, this time from the
β-carbon on the side chain, is abstracted, forming an enamine
intermediate (step 2). The phenolic proton on the pyridoxal ring of PLP
donates a proton to the nitrogen. In step 3, the leaving is expelled and
a new π-bond forms between the β and γ carbons (step 3). This π-bond is
short-lived, however, as the electron density from the first proton
abstraction, which has been 'stored' in PLP all this time, flows back up
to protonate the α-carbon (step 4), leaving the γ-elimination product
linked to PLP via the usual imine connection.

An example is the cystathionine γ-lyase reaction in the methionine
degradation pathway (EC 4.4.1.1):

<img src="media/image745.png"
style="width:4.05556in;height:1.86111in" />

fig 28

A related reaction is PLP-dependent γ-substitution, which again is
simply γ-elimination of a leaving group (X in the figure below) followed
directly by the reverse process (a γ-addition) with a different
nucleophile ('Nu' in the figure below).

PLP-dependent γ-substitution:

degradation pathway (EC 4.2.1.22):

### 17.1H: Racemase to aldolase: altering the course of a PLP reaction 

We have seen how PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a variety of reaction
types - racemization, retroaldol/retro-Claisen cleavage,
transaminination, elimination, and substitution - which, despite their
apparent diversity, are all characterized by formation of a critical
carbanion intermediate which is stabilized by the 'electron sink'
property of the PLP coenzyme. Given this common mechanistic feature, it
would be reasonable to propose that the active site architecture of
these enzymes might also be quite close. This idea was nicely
illustrated by an experiment in which researchers found that changing a
single active site amino acid of PLP-dependent alanine racemase was
sufficient to turn it into a retro-aldolase (*J. Am. Chem. Soc*.
**2003**, *125*, 10158).

In the 'wild-type' (natural) alanine racemase reaction, an active site
histidine (red in figure below) deprotonates a neighboring tyrosine
residue (blue), which in turn acts as the catalytic base abstracting the
α-proton of the substrate. When researchers changed the tyrosine to an
alanine (using a technique called 'site-directed mutagenesis'), and
substituted β-hydroxytyrosine for the alanine substrate, the new
'mutant' enzyme catalyzed a retro-aldol reaction.

<img src="media/image749.png"
style="width:3.93542in;height:5.07431in" />

fig 32

Notice what has happened here: the basic histidine, with no tyrosine to
deprotonate because of the mutation, is instead positioned to abstract a
proton from the β-hydroxyl group of the new substrate, setting up a
retroaldol cleavage. That was all it took to change a racemase into a
retroaldolase, because the necessary PLP electron sink system was all
left in place. The researchers predicted correctly that the phenyl ring
of β-hydroxy tyrosine would fit nicely in the space left empty due to
the tyrosine to alanine change in the mutant enzyme's structure

These results underline the close mechanistic relationship between two
PLP-dependent reactions which, at first glance, appear to be quite
different - and suggest that PLP-dependent racemases and aldolases may
have evolved from a common 'ancestor' enzyme.

### 17.1I: Stereoelectronic considerations of PLP-dependent reactions

Recall that all PLP-dependent reactions involve the cleavage of one of
the bonds coming from the α-carbon of an amino acid substrate, with the
coenzyme serving as an 'electron sink' to stabilize the intermediate
that results. PLP-dependent enzymes accelerate this bond-breaking step
by binding the substrate-PLP adduct in a conformation such that the bond
being broken is close to perpendicular to the plane formed by the
conjugated π system of PLP: this way, as the α-carbon transitions from
sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization, the unhybridized *p*
orbital is already oriented to overlap with the rest of the conjugated
system. For example, in alanine racemase the first step is cleavage of
the Cα-H bond, so it must be that bond which is positioned
near-perpendicular to the PLP plane:

<img src="media/image750.png" style="width:6in;height:3.06849in" />

Likewise, in an amino acid decarboxylase, the Cα-carboxylate bond is
held near-perpendicular to the PLP plane, and in
hydroxymethyltransferase, the Cα-Cβ bond is in the perpendicular
orientation:

<img src="media/image751.png"
style="width:5.52778in;height:1.58333in" />

These are all good examples of how enzymatic catalysis is achieved, in
part, by the ability of the active site to bind the substrate molecule
in a specific conformation which contributes to the lowering of the
activation energy of a key reaction step.

## Section 17.2: Thiamine diphosphate (Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>)

Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP, sometimes also abbreviated TPP or ThPP) is a
coenzyme which, like PLP, acts as an electron sink to stabilize key
carbanion intermediates. The most important part of the ThDP molecule
from a catalytic standpoint is its thiazole ring.

<img src="media/image752.png"
style="width:2.32431in;height:1.63889in" />

fig 33

The proton on the carbon between nitrogen and sulfur on the thiazole
ring is weakly acidic, with a pKa of about 18.

<img src="media/image753.png"
style="width:2.46319in;height:1.27778in" />

fig 34

The reason for its acidity lies partly in the ability of the neighboring
sulfur atom to accept, in its open *d*-orbitals, some of the excess
electron density of the conjugate base. Another reason is that the
positive charge on the nitrogen helps to stabilize the negative charge
on the conjugate base. The deprotonated thiazole is called an **ylide,**
which is a general term for a species with adjacent positively and
negatively charged atoms.

The negatively charged carbon on the ylide form of ThDP is nucleophilic,
and as we shall soon see, the first step of most TPP-dependent reactions
is nucleophilic attack of the ylide carbon on a carbonyl group of the
reaction substrate.

ThDP plays a key role in a variety of reaction types, but the common
theme in all ThDP-dependent reactions is cleavage of a bond adjacent to
the carbonyl carbon of a ketone or aldehyde.

Thiamine diphosphate assists in breaking bonds next to a ketone or
aldehyde:

Consider this hypothetical decarboxylation step:

fig 37

Hopefully, you can quickly recognize that this is *not* a chemically
reasonable step, because the intermediate species which results from
decarboxylation has a negative charge localized on the ketone carbon - a
very unstable, unlikely intermediate indeed.

(Recall from section 13.1 that decarboxylation steps usually result in
intermediates in which the negative formal charge is delocalized to an
oxygen or nitrogen - in other words, enolates or enamines.)

Now consider, however, a reaction going on in your cells right now,
catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1):

<img src="media/image756.png"
style="width:3.18542in;height:0.87986in" />

fig 36

Somehow, the enzyme manages to accomplish this 'impossible'
decarboxylation. How does this happen? Here is where the thiamine
diphosphate coenzyme comes in.

A ThDP-dependent decarboxylation reaction (pyruvate decarboxylase):

<img src="media/image757.png"
style="width:2.99097in;height:0.72222in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image758.png"
style="width:5.99097in;height:4.51875in" />

fig 36a fig 38

Upon binding to the enzyme's active site, ThDP quickly loses a proton.
The nucleophilic ylide carbon then adds to the carbonyl carbon of
pyruvate.

Look carefully at the intermediate that results from step 1 in the
mechanism above. The thiazole ring of ThDP, once it has added to the
carbonyl of pyruvate, provides an 'electron sink' to absorb the
electrons from decarboxylation (step 2). Note which bond is breaking in
step 2 - as was mentioned earlier, the common function of ThDP is to
make possible the cleavage of a bond to a carbonyl carbon.

In step 3, the electrons from decarboxylation flow back to abstract a
proton from an acidic group in the active site. All that remains is for
the product to break free of thiamine in step 4.

Thiamine can also assist in decarboxylation-addition reactions:

ThDP-dependent decarboxylation-addition:

<img src="media/image759.png"
style="width:4.05556in;height:0.79653in" />

Mechanism:

<img src="media/image760.png"
style="width:5.52778in;height:5.02778in" />

fig 39a fig 39

Here, the electron-rich intermediate formed from the decarboxylation
step (step 2) simply goes on to act as a nucleophile rather than as a
base, adding to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone (step 3). As
before, the product breaks free of ThDP in step 4.

An example is the first step in the biosynthetic pathway for isoprenoid
compounds in bacteria:

<img src="media/image761.png"
style="width:5.26875in;height:0.80556in" />

fig 40

Transketolase, a ThDP-dependent enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway
of sugar metabolism, catalyzes a carbon-carbon bond break step, followed
by a carbon-carbon bond forming step. The substrates and products are at
similar energy levels, so the reaction is completely reversible.

common for sugar structures).

<u>Exercise 17.6</u>: As was mentioned above, the transketolase reaction
is highly reversible. Do you think the same can be said for the
decarboxylation and decarboxylation-addition reactions we saw in this
section? Why or why not?

<u>Exercise 17.7</u>: (Challenging!) Propose a mechanism for the
reaction below. Hint: This is a ThDP-facilitated decarboxylation/

## Section 17.3: Thiamine diphosphate, lipoamide and the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction

The enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase is one of the most central of all the
enzymes of central metabolism: by converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, it
links glycolysis (where glucose is broken down into pyruvate) to the
citric acid cycle, into which carbons enter in the form of acetyl-CoA.
Five ceonzymes are involved: coenzyme A, nicotinamide, thiamine
diphosphate, FAD, and finally lipoamide, one which is new to us at this
point.

Reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase:

<img src="media/image767.png" style="width:3.25in;height:1.27778in" />

fig 45

You will learn more about the structure and metabolic role of this
complex and remarkable enzyme in a biochemistry course. Here, we will
focus on the multi-step organic reaction it catalyzes, which we are at
long last equipped to understand.

Looking at the reaction, you should recognize that, first of all, the
pyruvate substrate is being oxidized - it starts out as a ketone, and
ends up as a thioester, losing carbon dioxide in the process.
Ultimately, the oxidizing agent in this reaction is NAD<sup>+</sup>, but
the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> is linked to the oxidative
decarboxylation of pyruvate by FAD and a disulfide-containing coenzyme
called **lipoamide**, which is lipoic acid attached by an amide linkage
to a lysine residue on the enzyme.

<img src="media/image768.png" style="width:4in;height:3.58333in" />

fig 45a

The second thing to notice is that, because the reaction involves
breaking the bond between the ketone carbon and an adjacent carbon,
thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) coenzyme is required. In fact, the first
phase of the reaction (steps 1 and 2 below) is identical to that of
pyruvate *decarboxylase*, an enzyme we discussed a few pages ago.

The pyruvate decarboxylase reaction mechanism

Phase 1: Decarboxylation of pyruvate

<img src="media/image769.png"
style="width:5.18542in;height:2.15764in" />

fig 46

The ThDP-stabilized carbanion then acts as a nucleophile, cleaving the
disulfide bridge of lipoamide (step 3 below). It is in this step that
oxidation of the substrate is actually occurring. After the resulting
thioester product is released from ThDP (step 4 below), it undergoes
transesterification form acetyl-CoA, the product of the reaction.

Phase 2 of the pyruvate decarboxylase reaction mechanism:
lipoamide-mediate oxidation to acetyl-CoA

<img src="media/image770.png"
style="width:5.87986in;height:4.08333in" />

fig 47

We are not done yet! In order for the catalytic cycle to be complete,
the reduced dihydrolipoamide must be regenerated back to its oxidized
state through disulfide exchange with a disulfide bond on the enzyme.
The pair of enzymatic cysteines is then oxidized back to disulfide form
by an FAD-dependent reaction.

Phase 3 of the pyruvate decarboxylase reaction mechanism: regeneration
of lipoamide

<img src="media/image771.png"
style="width:4.85208in;height:4.19444in" />

fig 48

Finally, FAD is regenerated with concurrent reduction of
NAD<sup>+</sup>:

## Section 17.4: Folate 

Folate, or vitamin B<sub>9</sub>, is essential for a variety of
important reactions in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. The
reactive part of folate is the **pterin** ring system, shown in red
below. The conventional atom numbering system for folate is also
indicated.

<img src="media/image773.png"
style="width:3.83333in;height:1.90764in" />

fig 50

### 17.4A: Active forms of folate

Folate is active as a coenzyme in its reduced forms, dihydrofolate and
tetrahydrofolate, which are formed by NADPH-dependent imine
hydrogenation steps (section 15.3).

<img src="media/image774.png"
style="width:4.93542in;height:4.30556in" />

fig 51

The metabolic role of folate is to serve as a donor or acceptor in
single-carbon transfer reactions. How is folate different from
*S*-adenosylmethionine (SAM, section 8.8A) which also serves as a
single-carbon donor? Recall that SAM donates a single carbon in the form
of a methyl group: essentially, the single carbon of SAM is in the
methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) oxidation state, because it has only one
bond to a heteroatom (specifically, to sulfur). (Refer to section 15.1
for a review of oxidation states).

<img src="media/image775.png"
style="width:3.43542in;height:2.08333in" />

fig 52a

Folate coenzymes, on the other hand, can carry a single carbon in the
*formaldehyde* and *formate* oxidation states, in addition to the
methanol oxidation state. By 'formaldehyde' and 'formate' oxidation
state, we mean that the carbon has two and three bonds to heteroatoms,
respectively.

<img src="media/image776.png"
style="width:3.90764in;height:6.51875in" />

fig 52

Some key reactions in nucleic acid and amino acid metabolic pathways
involve transfer of a single carbon in the formaldehyde or formate
states. However, this could present problems. Formaldehyde by itself is
very toxic: in particular, it tends to spontaneously form unwanted
crosslinks between amine groups (eg. lysine side chains) in proteins.

<img src="media/image777.png"
style="width:5.21319in;height:1.85208in" />

fig 53

Free formaldehyde is *too reactive*, and would cause damage to a cell.
The CH<sub>2</sub>-THF coenzyme is stable in solution, but in the active
site of certain enzymes it is reactive enough to serve as a formaldehyde
donor, as we will see shortly.

Free formate, on the other hand, is a carboxylate, and we know from
chapter 11 that carboxylates are *not reactive* in acyl substitution
steps. Formate could be activated by phosphorylation, of course, but the
resulting formyl phosphate would be *too* reactive in many enzyme active
sites. A 'happy medium' has been found in which carbons in the formate
oxidation state are carried by folate in the form of f-THF: once again,
the carbon donor is stable in solution, but sufficiently reactive in
certain enzyme active sites to accomplish controlled transfer of a
formate group.

### 17.4B: Formation of formyl-THF and methylene-THF 

Formyltetrahydrofolate (f-THF) is formed from THF and a formate molecule
which has been activated by phosphorylation (formyl phosphate, as stated
in the paragraph above, is a high reactive intermediate, but is held
inside the enzyme's active site for immediate reaction with the incoming
amine group of THF).

<img src="media/image778.png"
style="width:5.72222in;height:2.76875in" />

fig 54

There are two main metabolic routes to CH<sub>2</sub>-THF. One route is
just the last step of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction we
have already seen in section 17.1D: the formaldehyde formed in the
PLP-dependent phase of the reaction stays in the active site, and the
oxygen is displaced by successive attacks from the amine nucleophiles at
the 5 and 10 positions of THF. (Notice the similarity to the
formaldehyde-protein crosslinking reaction shown earlier in this
section.)

<img src="media/image779.png"
style="width:5.51875in;height:3.32431in" />

fig 55

In the second route, f-THF is dehydrated, then the resulting
methenyl-THF intermediate is reduced by NADPH.

<img src="media/image780.png"
style="width:4.55556in;height:4.62986in" />

fig 56

Methylene-THF (CH<sub>2</sub>-THF) is reduced to methyl-THF
(CH<sub>3</sub>-THF) in a flavin-dependent reaction. *Biochemistry*
**2001**, *40*, 6216

<img src="media/image781.png"
style="width:4.91667in;height:1.88889in" />

fig 56a

Recall from the introduction to this chapter that babies who were in the
womb during the Dutch Hunger Winter faced a higher risk, when they
reached adulthood, of conditions such as obesity and schizophrenia, most
likely caused by disruptions in the *S*-adenosylmethionine-dependent
methylation of their DNA, which was in turn caused by their mothers not
getting enough folate. CH<sub>3</sub>-THF is the source of the methyl
group in methionine, which ultimately becomes the methyl group in SAM.
The methylation of homocysteine to methionine (below) involves a
cobalt-containing coenzyme called cobalamin, but the mechanism for this
reaction is beyond the scope of our discussion. The second reaction
below (formation of SAM) is simply an S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement of the
inorganic triphosphate leaving group on ATP by the nucleophilic sulfur
in methionine.

<img src="media/image782.png"
style="width:4.11111in;height:4.68542in" />

fig 56b

### 17.4C: Single-carbon transfer with formyl-THF 

There are two important f-THF-dependent formylation steps in the
biosynthetic pathways for purine nucleophiles. Both are simply
transamidation reactions: in other words, conversion by the nucleophilic
acyl substitution mechanism (chapter 11) of one amide to another.

Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase reaction:

<img src="media/image783.png"
style="width:4.02778in;height:4.02778in" />

Aminoimidazole carboxamide transformylase reaction:

style="width:4.47222in;height:1.65764in" />

fig 58

<u>Exercise 17.9</u>: Which of the two transformylase reactions above
would you expect to be more kinetically favorable? Explain your
reasoning.

<u>Exercise 17.10</u>: Predict the structure of 'product X' in the
reaction below, from the histidine degradation pathway.

<img src="media/image785.png"
style="width:5.80556in;height:1.52778in" />

fig 59

### 17.4D: Single-carbon transfer with methylene-THF

CH<sub>2</sub>-THF serves as a single-carbon donor in a somewhat
complicated reaction in the biosynthesis of the DNA monomer
doexythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).

<img src="media/image786.png"
style="width:3.82431in;height:1.76875in" />

fig 60

The reactions begins with the five-membered ring of CH<sub>2</sub>-THF
breaking apart to create an imine intermediate (step 1 below). The imine
becomes an electrophile in a conjugate addition step (section 13.4,
steps 2-3 below). Note that after step 1, the second ring in the pterin
system of the coenzyme is abbreviated for clarity.

<img src="media/image787.png" style="width:6in;height:2.90633in" />

fig 61

Next, tetrahydrofolate is eliminated in an E1cb elimination mechanism
(steps 4 and 5). Notice that this is where the single carbon is
transferred from methyl-THF to dUMP.

<img src="media/image788.png" style="width:5.75in;height:2.93542in" />

fig 62

The final step in the mechanism is where it gets *really* interesting: a
hydride ion is transferred from the tetrahydrofolate coenzyme to the
methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) group on the deoxynucleotide substrate.
Essentially, this is a *conjugated* S<sub>N</sub>2 step with hydride as
the nucleophile and the active site cysteine as the leaving group.

## Key learning objectives for this chapter

*After completing this chapter, you should be able to:*

Understand how pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) acts as an 'electron sink' in a
variety of reactions in amino acid metabolism.

Recognize and draw mechanisms for PLP-dependent transformations of the
following types:

racemization

decarboxylation

transamination

retroaldol cleavage

retro-Claisen cleavage

β-elimination

β-substitution

γ-elimination

γ-substitution

Recognize transformations - amino acid decarboxylation and
transamination, for example - in which chemical steps occur that simply
don't 'make sense' unless the electron sink role of PLP is taken into
account.

Understand how the orientation of the substrate in relation to the plane
formed by the conjugated π system of PLP is a major factor in catalysis
of PLP-dependent reactions.

Understand how thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) acts as an 'electron sink' in
a variety of reactions in which a bond to a carbonyl carbon is broken,
and how these steps do not 'make sense' unless the electron sink role of
ThDP is taken into account.

Recognize transformations for which ThDP is likely required, and be able
to draw reasonable mechanisms for them.

Understand how ThDP acts in tandem with lipoamide, flavin, and
nicotinamide in the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase.

Recognize folate in its various forms - DHF, THF, f-THF,
CH<sub>2</sub>-THF, and CH<sub>3</sub>-THF - functions in a variety of
one-carbon transfer steps. Be able to recognize the oxidation state of
the carbon being transferred in a folate-depenent step.

## Problems

**P17.1:** Here is a chance to test your ability to recognize reactions
catalyzed by enzymes using three coenzymes - thiamine diphosphate,
pyridoxal phosphate, and folate - that we have studied in this chapter.
For each generalized reaction, look carefully at the transformation that
is taking place, and decide which of the three coenzymes is likely to be
required. Then, draw the single mechanistic step by which the bond
identified by an arrow is broken or formed. In the cases where a double
bond is indicated, show the mechanistic step in which the *σ bond* is
formed. In each case, your drawing should include the structure of the
reactive part of the coenzyme, and should clearly show the role it plays
in catalyzing the mechanistic step you are drawing.

**P17.8**:

a\) The 'benzoin condensation' reaction was discovered in the 19th
century, and led eventually to a better understanding of ThDP-dependent
reactions in the cell. In a traditional benzoin condensation reaction,
cyanide ion (instead of ThDP) plays the role of electron acceptor.
Enzyme-catalyzed benzoin condensation reactions are also known to occur
in some bacteria*:* Pseudomonas fluorescens, for example, contains an
enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of (R)-benzoin.

<img src="media/image812.png"
style="width:4.30556in;height:1.29653in" />

a\) Draw a mechanism for the enzyme-catalyzed (ThDP-dependent) benzoin
condensation reaction*.*

b\) Draw a mechanism for the cyanide-catalyzed benzoin condensation
reaction (non-enzymatic, basic conditions).

c\) The following ThDP-reaction was recently reported to be part of the
biosynthetic pathway for clavulanic acid, a compound that inhibits the
action of β-lactamases (β-lactamases are bacterial enzymes that
hydrolyze penicillin-based antibiotic drugs, rendering them
ineffective). As is typical for ThDP-dependent reactions, the first step
is addition of the ylide form of the coenzyme to the substrate carbonyl.
The next steps are (in order): dehydration, tautomerization, elimination
of phosphate, conjugate addition of arginine, and finally hydrolytic
cleavage of the coenzyme-product bond. Draw out a complete mechanism
that corresponds to this description.

**P17.9:** Practice with PLP-dependent reactions:

tryptophan degradation pathway (EC 3.7.1.3).

<img src="media/image814.png"
style="width:4.40764in;height:0.92569in" />

pathway (EC 4.2.3.1).

style="width:3.27778in;height:1.21319in" />

c\) Propose a mechanism for the reaction catalyzed by aspartate
β-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.12), which converts aspartate to alanine in a
PLP-dependent reaction.

d\) Sphingolipids are a type of membrane lipid found in the membranes of
all eukaryotic cells, and are most abundant in the cells of central the
central nervous system. Synthesis of sphingolipids involves the
PLP-dependent reaction below, catalyzed by serine palmitoyl transferase
(EC 2.3.1.50). Propose a mechanism.

<img src="media/image816.png"
style="width:3.33333in;height:2.90764in" />

**P17.10:** As we saw in this chapter, PLP-dependent enzymes usually
catalyze reactions involving amino acid substrates. Here is an
exception, a PLP-dependent β-elimination reaction in the folate
biosynthetic pathway (EC 4.1.3.38). Propose a mechanism for this
reaction.

<img src="media/image817.png"

**P17.11:** The final step in the degradation pathway for the amino acid
glycine (also known as the 'glycine cleavage system') is shown below.
Propose a likely mechanism, given that

evidence suggests that CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is an
intermediate.

<img src="media/image818.png"
style="width:3.13889in;height:0.93056in" />

**P17.12:** As we saw in chapter 15, the usual biochemical role of
NAD<sup>+</sup> is to act as a hydride acceptor in dehydrogenation
reactions. An exception is the reaction catalyzed by the histidine
degradation pathway enzyme urocanase (EC 4.2.1.49).

<img src="media/image819.png"
style="width:3.53333in;height:1.26667in" />

In this reaction, NAD<sup>+</sup> acts as a catalytic, electron-sink
coenzyme - it temporarily accepts electrons from a pi bond in the
substrate, resulting in a covalent substrate-NAD adduct. This allows a
key isomerization step to occur on the substrate through a
protonation-deprotonation mechanism, followed by addition of water,
cleavage of the substrate-NAD adduct to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup>, and
finally tautomerization to the product. Propose a mechanism that fits
this description, and involves the intermediate below.

**P17.13:** Propose a multistep pathway for each of the following
transformations. All involve at least one step requiring PLP, ThDP, or
folate.

a\) Below is portion of the biosynthesis of a modified membrane lipid in
*Salmonella* and other pathogenic bacteria. The modified membrane
confers antibiotic resistance to the bacterium. *Biochemistry* **2014**,

b\) Below is the biosynthetic pathway for phenethanol in yeast.
Phenethanol, which has a rose scent, is commonly used as a fragrance -
this pathway has been proposed as a potential 'green' enzymatic
synthesis to replace the traditional industrial synthesis, which uses
toxic reagents.

e\) We begin our study of organic chemistry with a story about a hot
pepper eating contest in Wisconsin (see the introduction the Chapter 1),
and a compound called capsaicin which causes the 'hot' in hot peppers.
As our last problem, let's try to predict some of the key steps in the
biosynthesis of capsaicin.

Phase 1:
